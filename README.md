# Classification with Softmax Activation Neural Networks in TensorFlow and Keras

## Overview

Welcome to this repository showcasing an example of building and training a neural network for classification tasks using TensorFlow and Keras. In this demonstration, we walk through the fundamental steps of developing a neural network model for multi-class classification problems.

## Components

1. **Neural Network Architecture**: We define a simple feedforward neural network architecture using Keras' `Sequential` API. Our network comprises three densely connected layers, each utilizing ReLU activation functions. The final layer employs a softmax activation function, which is pivotal for multi-class classification tasks, as it outputs probabilities across multiple classes.

2. **Softmax Activation Function**: The softmax activation function is a central component of our neural network architecture. It converts the output of the previous layer into probability distributions across the different classes. This ensures that the sum of the probabilities for all classes equals one, enabling intuitive interpretation and decision-making.

3. **Dataset Generation**: Synthetic data generation is facilitated by `make_blobs` from scikit-learn. This dataset is employed for training our neural network, providing a controlled environment for experimentation.

4. **Model Training**: After compiling the model with a sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer, we proceed to train it on the generated dataset using the `model.fit` method.

5. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Post-training, the model predicts the probabilities of each class for the training data using `model.predict`. We then print these predictions along with the maximum and minimum values for further analysis.

6. **Preferred Model**: Additionally, we define a preferred model, identical to the original one but with a linear activation function in the output layer. This modification is preferred when dealing with raw logits, enhancing the model's interpretability.

7. **Softmax Transformation**: Finally, we apply a softmax transformation to the output of the preferred model. This transformation converts raw logits into probabilities, facilitating a clearer interpretation of the model's output.
